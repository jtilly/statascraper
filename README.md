R Package that extracts tables from STATA log files

This package scrapes STATA log files, looks for tables generated by `tab`, `tabstat`, `reg`, and `areg` and then returns these tables as R matrices or stores them as comma separated value files. This package can be useful, when researchers (have to) use STATA to work with data sets but want to use R to analyze and display results.
